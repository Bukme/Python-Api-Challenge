# WeatherPy and VacationPy APIs

## Introduction
WeatherPy and VacationPy are Python scripts designed to analyze weather data and find ideal vacation spots based on weather conditions. WeatherPy retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and creates visualizations to showcase relationships between various weather variables and latitude. VacationPy utilizes this weather data to identify ideal vacation spots based on user-defined weather conditions.

## Setup
To run these scripts, you need to obtain API keys for both OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify.

### API Keys
1. **OpenWeatherMap API Key**: You can obtain an API key by signing up on the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/api) and generating an API key.
    ```python
    weather_api_key = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
    ```

2. **Geoapify API Key**: You can obtain an API key by signing up on the [Geoapify website](https://www.geoapify.com/) and generating an API key.
    ```python
    geoapify_key = "YOUR_GEOAPIFY_API_KEY"
    ```

## Output Files
All output files (CSV and PNG) are stored in the `output_data` folder.

## WeatherPy
### Dependencies
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Requests
- SciPy
- Citipy

### Usage
1. Run the `weather.py` script.
    ```bash
    python weather.py
    ```

### Description
- Generates a list of random cities.
- Retrieves weather data for each city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Creates scatter plots showcasing relationships between latitude and various weather variables (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed).
- Performs linear regression analysis to determine the correlation between latitude and weather variables in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
- Saves output plots as PNG files in the `output_data` folder.

## VacationPy
### Dependencies
- Pandas
- Requests
- Hvplot
- Geoapify

### Usage
1. Run the `vacation.py` script.
    ```bash
    python vacation.py
    ```

### Description
- Retrieves city data from the CSV file generated by WeatherPy.
- Filters the city data to find ideal vacation spots based on user-defined weather conditions.
- Uses the Geoapify API to find nearby hotels for each vacation spot.
- Creates a map with markers for each vacation spot and nearby hotel.
- Saves the map as a PNG file in the `output_data` folder.
